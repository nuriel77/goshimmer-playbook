## Requirements

Tested on the following operating systems:

* CentOS 7.x, CentOS 8.x
* Ubuntu 18/19/20.04LTS
* Debian 9.5 and 10
* Raspbian 9.9 and 10 (Tested with Raspberry Pi 4 - 4GB RAM)

Architectures (x86_64, arm/aarch 64 bit)

## Recommendations

* RAM: At least 2GB RAM, as less than this can result in out-of-memory failures.
* x2 CPUs are recommended

## Installation

You can first download the script to inspect it before running it, or run it directly:

```sh
sudo bash -c "bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuriel77/goshimmer-playbook/master/goshimmer_install.sh)"
```
This pulls the installation file from the root of this repository and executes it.

The installation will:

* Install latest GoShimmer and start it up.
* Configure basic security (firewalls) and open all required ports for GoShimmer to operate.
* Install nginx as a reverse proxy to access GoShimmer's Dashboard, spammer, etc.
* Add some helpful tools, e.g.: `gosc`

### For Development

If you are working on a fork in a feature branch or happen to directly contribute to this repository you can run the installer as user root, pointing it to the appropriate branch, e.g.:
```sh
BRANCH="dev-branch"; GIT_OPTIONS="-b $BRANCH" bash <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuriel77/goshimmer-playbook/$BRANCH/goshimmer_install.sh")
```

## Docker Usage Commands

These are just a few helpful commands to help you find your way around docker:

### Docker Images

List all images
```sh
docker images
```
The output will look something like:
```sh
REPOSITORY             TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
iotaledger/goshimmer   588e0ff             506e4a44db0d        2 days ago          23MB
iotaledger/goshimmer   af1fee9             ffef5d662ba0        6 days ago          23MB
nginx                  latest              e445ab08b2be        2 weeks ago         126MB
golang                 1.12-alpine         6b21b4c6e7a3        4 weeks ago         350MB
alpine                 latest              b7b28af77ffe        4 weeks ago         5.58MB
```
Note that an image consists of a "REPOSITORY" name and a "TAG". Above we have 2 `iotaledger/goshimmer` images. The older can be deleted if no longer in use.

Delete a certain image (or example an older version of goshimmer you don't use anymore):
```sh
docker rmi iotaledger/goshimmer:v0.1
```

### View Docker Containers

View all docker containers:
```sh
docker ps -a
```

### GoShimmer Help Output
Run goshimmer with `--help`: given that we know the image name and the tag. A quick way to get the tag variable configured:
```sh
docker run --rm -it iotaledger/goshimmer:9fda4b8 --help
```

You can get the tag by viewing all images, or check the configuration file to see what is the currently used TAG:

On CentOS:
```sh
grep ^TAG /etc/sysconfig/goshimmer
```

On Ubuntu/Debian/Raspbian:
```sh
grep ^TAG /etc/default/goshimmer
```

## Configuration

In the file below we can specify the image and tag to use. In addition we can configure which command line arguments to pass to goshimmer:

* On Ubuntu: `/etc/default/goshimmer`

* On CentOS: `/etc/sysconfig/goshimmer`

## Control GoShimmer

Goshimmer app start:
```sh
systemctl start goshimmer
```
You can also replace `start` with `stop` or `restart`.

GoShimmer logs follow:

```sh
journalctl -u goshimmer -e -f
```
### Goshimmer Controller

A GUI utility has been added to help manage some basics like controlling the server, viewing logs, upgrading goshimmer etc.

Run:
```sh
sudo gosc
```

### Goshimmer DB
The database is located in `/var/lib/goshimmer/mainnetdb`

### Goshimmer Dashboard
Goshimmer dashboard is accessible by default via your public IP and port 8081. e.g:

```
https://mydomain.io:8081
```

You can login using the username and password you've selected during the installation.

#### Certificate Security Warning
*NOTE* You can safely ignore the browser's warning about the certificate, as a self-signed one has been generated during the installation.

### Spam Test
If you've enabled the spammer plugin (e.g. via `gosc`) you can start or stop spamming from the commandline.

No need to open ports, forward ports etc, no need for browser. You can run on the commandline:
```sh
curl "http://localhost:8012/spammer?cmd=start"
```

You can add the parameter "tps=<number>" to specify how many TPS to spam with, for example:
```sh
curl "http://localhost:8012/spammer?cmd=start&tps=100"
```

To stop:
```sh
curl "http://localhost:8012/spammer?cmd=stop"
```

Note that for security reasons the spammer is not made available on the browser by default.

You can enable it on the browser by running:
```
grep -q "^goshimmer_webapi_external_address: 0.0.0.0" /opt/goshimmer-playbook/group_vars/all/z-installer-override.yml || echo "goshimmer_webapi_external_address: 0.0.0.0" >> /opt/goshimmer-playbook/group_vars/all/z-installer-override.yml
```

Then run the following to apply the change:
```sh
cd /opt/goshimmer-playbook && ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml -v --tags=nginx_role
```

For the browser use https and port 8080. You will also have to login.

# Ports

Here's a list of ports configured by the playbook by default. External communication for dashboard, webapi grafana etc. goes via nginx that serves as a reverse proxy. Other ports (fpc, gossip and autopeering) are exposed directly on the host.

NAME               | PORT INTERNAL | PORT EXTERNAL | PROTOCOL | DESCRIPTION
-------------------|---------------|---------------|----------|--------------------------------
Autopeering        | 14626         | 14626         | UDP      | Autopeering
Gossip             | 14666         | 14666         | TCP      | Gossip
FPC                | 10895         | 10895         | TCP      | FPC
Dashboard          | 8011          | 8081          | TCP      | Main dashboard
WebAPI             | 8012          | 8080          | TCP      | WebApi
Grafana            | 3000          | 5555          | TCP      | Grafana monitoring
Prometheus         | 9090          | 8999          | TCP      | Prometheus metrics
Alertmanager       | 9093          | 9993          | TCP      | Alertmanager for prometheus

All the external ports have been made accessible in the firewall. There is no need to configure the firewall on the node.

### Forward Ports

If you are running the node in an internal network/lan you have to forward at least the following ports from the router to the node:

10895/tcp, 14666/tcp, 14626/udp

# Appendix

## Install Alongside IRI-Playbook

It is possible to run this installation on an IRI-playbook node. You must have enough RAM and CPU power to accommodate both.

A few notes:

* This has only been tested in the case where you already have a Dockerized IRI-playbook node and run this installer afterwards.
* GoShimmer-playbook re-uses IRI's HTTPS configuration (SSL certificate)
* You will also be able to access the web services using the user you have configured for IRI
